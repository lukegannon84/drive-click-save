Fleet management android app, web based management system

Drive Click Save is an android application which works alongside a three tier architecture web management application.
It has been developed so that the users of the android application can send information back to the server so that it
can be recorded and viewed by the company. 

The information which gets recorded is fuel, hotel, materials and food costs along with an image of any receipts to 
verify expenses.  It also allows for their journey to be tracked, from their starting location and start times to 
their end location and end times.
